<font size="5"><i><p>Those parts which are found inside a computer CPU are called the 
hardwares of a computer.</p>
<p>CPU is the central processing unit so it will definately contain many parts like Motherboard
, RAM, Cooling fan, Power supply (SMPS), Processor etc.</p>
<p>Some of them are described below</p></font></i>


<font size="7" color="purple"><b><u>Processor</b></u></font>
<font size="5"><i><p>It is a Chip which is fitted on the motherboard of a CPU and does all the 
processes as its name says.
</p><img src="20.jpg" height="150" width="250" align="right">
<p>When we open any software or any programe then the process which takes place is processing
 and all the processing is done by processor</p>
</i></font>

<font size="7" color="blue"><b><u>Motherboard</b></u></font><br>
<font size="5"><i><p>It is a green plate where all the connections of a computer system
 CPU  take place.</p>

<p>Processor, RAM, Cooling fan, USB hub connector etc all cables are connected here so 
if it will not work then nothing is possible.</p>

<font size="7" color="olive"><b><u>RAM</b></u></font><br>
<font size="5"><i><p>It is a green plate which is small in size it also like processor as it affects
 the speed but the function is quite different.</p>

<p>When we install a software then it gets install in drive but it occupies the cache and running
 memory in RAM. So we can say that processor and RAM both affects the speed of system.</p>
